# MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION TASKS
This project contains the implementation of Machine Learning models for five different classification tasks. The models are trained and tested are:
-  Random Forest
-  Tree Stumps with AdaBoost
-  Artificial Neural Network
-  K-Nearest Neighbors

Each of the Machine Learning models is implemented in a separate class, which can be instantiated, trained and evaluated on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The models are stratified 5-fold cross-validated. The standard deviation of the accuracy of the models and the average accuracy is calculated and reported.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of these implementations, the models are trained and tested on the following datasets:
-  Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
-  Holistic Evaluation of Cars
-  Letter Recognition
-  Ecoli Localization Site
-  Mushroom Edibility
